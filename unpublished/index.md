Born and bred in the Northwest, I am a new resident of Arizona. My husband and I
raised three amazing children, all adults and out of the house. Our daughter has
four children of her own. Being grandma now is more meaningful to me than I ever
could have imagined.

I grew up, hanging out with my dad at the airport, and continued working in
aviation most of my career life. I have a degree in aviation business
administration and ran my own aircraft cleaning business. I worked in corporate
aviation in a range of capacities for many years. Now I am using my business and
life experiences to provide solutions in other businesses. I offer content
writing, business consulting and administration, homeschool consulting, team leadership, and other services to help you be successful in your work.

My experiences include: homeschool co-op management, education facilitation, facility management, project management, communications management, procurement management, safety management, business administration

Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going. Ecclesiastes 9:10
