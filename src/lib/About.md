# Test Bio

Born and bred in the Northwest, I am a new resident of Arizona. My husband and I
raised three amazing children, all adults and out of the house. Our daughter has
four children of her own. Being grandma now is more meaningful to me than I ever
could have imagined.

I grew up, hanging out with my dad at the airport, and continued working in
aviation most of my career life.
