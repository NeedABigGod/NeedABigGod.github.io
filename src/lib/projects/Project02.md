# Ground Support Equipment Training Project

All facility ground support equipment required initial and recurrent training.  This project created a training plan, documentation, and schedule.  The costs were limited due to being able to use in-house technologies.  The risks for completing the project successfully were limited as well.  The department was fully onboard with participating in the development of the training and their individual rolls in the project.
