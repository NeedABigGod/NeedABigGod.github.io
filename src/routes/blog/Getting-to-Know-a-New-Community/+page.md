If we learned one thing during the dark days of lock-down, it was how to research everything online.  This became a necessity in real estate.  People were even buying homes site-unseen because of all the restrictions on viewing homes in person.  Not all states had the same restrictions, but for those moving across state lines, it was very common for the entire real estate transaction to happen over the internet.  This was not easily adapted from the outset, but technology and practice have made the new era of online home shopping very appealing.

However, you still have to live in the community.  How do you know you will even like it if you haven't been there?  It is imperative you do your Due Diligence in researching the area before you finalize a home purchase.  Beyond the information found on a Residential Seller's Property Disclosure Statement (SPDS), which is required by law in Arizona, personally viewing the area of the property gives the buyer more information than can be listed by the seller.  Many features of a neighborhood will invoke an emotional response- either good or bad.

Even when you can visit a new community in person, doing some online research will help you know what to look for during your visit.  Sites like [City-Data](http://www.city-data.com/) and [Census.gov](https://data.census.gov/) have great descriptions of what makes up the community, including population, retail establishments, population density, relevant industries, and more.

<h3>How Can I Help You Learn More?</h3>
As a real estate agent, I have access to great resources to help my clients learn more about a community they may be considering.  I can even do virtual visits of a community, if that is a service that helps them make their best buying decision.

<h2>Visiting Tucson?</h2>
Consider stopping by these great local businesses:
