I was visiting my daughter recently. She is restoring a 1914 Colonial home and
is contemplating how to redo the landscaping. She mentioned the idea of building
a retaining wall around the property.

> restoration projects.

How fortunate to find this great article from Houselogic on how to build a
retaining wall.
