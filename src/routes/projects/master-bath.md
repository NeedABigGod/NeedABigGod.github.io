## Master Bath Update Project

The master bath in this mid-century modern home was anything but modern. This
project included updating ceiling electrical work, plumbing, and restructuring
the room floor plan. The time line was three months. The risks included weather
delays as the contractor hired to remove ceiling insulation was scheduled in
January. Costs were the biggest risk in this project. There were many unknown
construction issues so adjustments to supply purchases had to be made.
Additionally, the flooring and the shower door had delays in completion.


Initiation:  With most of the house updated, it was time to consider changing the master bedroom and creating a true master bath.  The room being used as a very large closet was cut in half to make space for a full-size shower, a water closet, linen storage, and a separate vanity area.  The supplier for the shower wall surface material was decided based on availability and quality of work.  A cabinet supplier for the vanity had to be considered for style, availability, and cost.  The attic insulation contractor would have to support electrical work scheduling.

Planning:  Project Time- January 2018- March 2018
Scope- This project included expanding the bathroom footprint- installing a full-size shower, creating a water closet, adding linen storage, and creating a separate vanity area.  The master room closet was reconfigured, the electrical wiring was updated, the plumbing was updated and reconfigured, and the flooring was changed.
Resources- Outside contractors would include attic insulation, shower wall installation, shower door installation.  The main source for supplies would local hardware stores- Lowe's, Home Depot, and Ace.  All other labor would be performed by home owner.
Schedule Management- An initial schedule was based on attic insulation contractor availability.  Room construction was scheduled based on shower wall installer contractor schedule.  Completion date was set based on flooring availability.
Changes- Supply availability, contractor scheduling, and other changes were closely monitored.  Updates were made after discussion with respective suppliers.

Execution:  The project commenced with the arrival of the attic insulation contractor to begin their part.  Once the insulation was removed, the electrical work could begin, which was required for all other work to be accomplished.

Management:  Milestones- Insulation removal, electrical wiring update, walls constructed and in place, lighting fixtures in place, plumbing work done, shower installation (including door), vanity in place, walls painted, flooring in place.  Completion- doors hung and trim in place
				
Review:
What went well and what didn't work out as planned- Shower nozzle not quite angled right, the shower is a little crowded;
