## Carriage House

This project entailed updating this accessory dwelling unit, making it a safe
and comfortable home for grandparents.

The timeline was about four months, with some tasks being expendable if the time
was cut short. Some risks included limited resources and unknown construction
situations.

Initiation:  When this property came on the market, the accessory dwelling unit made the purchase very attractive.  The small home needed a complete overhaul, including reconfiguring the bathroom footprint and installing a new hot water heater in a new location.  One major risk of this project was the plumbing configuration and not knowing if the plumbing ground lines could be updated.  Another risk was the accessibility of supplies in the small town, during the pandemic.

Planning:  This included setting up connections with vendors and local construction contractors.  a Schedule was set, which helped outline the project scope.  The short schedule helped limit the list of activities required to do this project  Limiting the activities also helped keep the project in budget.

Execution:  Due to the limited access of supplies, a daily update on project status included updating the supply list.  The home was originally a carriage house and was not built according to any building codes.  Plumbing and electric work had to be adjusted based on construction discovery.

Management:  The key to management and control of this project was daily stakeholder meetings.  Daily worked changed so quickly according to what supplies were available.  We also had to adjust the daily activity to meet the schedule and budget constraints.

Closure:  Remodel projects are easy to have closure.  When all the painting and cleaning is done, there is closure.  The deliverables are identifiable and the stakeholders and project sponsors can see where the project stands.  This project was no different.  Probably the most obvious deliverable was the completed flooring and the fresh paint.

Review:  The biggest failure of this project was the expectation of activities.  We expected to be able to do too much from the beginning.  We also did not plan for labor limitations.
