# Test Bio

Born and bred in the Northwest, I am a new resident of Arizona.  My husband and I raised three amazing children, all adults and out of the house.  Our daughter has four children of her own.  Being grandma now is more meaningful to me than I ever could have imagined.

I grew up, hanging out with my dad at the airport, and continued working in aviation most of my career life.  I have a degree in aviation business administration and ran my own aircraft cleaning business.  I worked in corporate aviation in a range of capacities for many years.  Now I am using my business and life experiences to provide solutions in other businesses.  I offer content writing, business administration, homeschool consulting.
