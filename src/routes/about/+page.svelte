			<p>
				I am a mom of three and grandma of four. My husband and I recently
				relocated to the Tucson area to escape the wet climate of the Pacific
				Northwest. Before becoming a real estate agent, I spent my career life
				in aviation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I grew up, hanging out at the airport with my dad, who was a maintenance
				director for a corporate flight department. I always enjoyed helping my
				dad work on airplanes and I continued to help him even after I had
				children. While raising my three children was my focus, when my husband
				was laid off from his job after 9/11, I turned my hobby business of
				cleaning airplanes into a full-time business. I continued working in
				corporate and general aviation until we had the opportunity to move to
				Arizona.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being self-employed, I was easily able to work homeschooling our
				children around my work. Homeschooling gave us a great opportunity to
				enjoy our children to the fullest, even on the hard days. Homeschooling
				our kids is one of my best life accomplishments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time we have with our kids is so short and it wasn't long before
				they were all out of our home and established in their own homes. When
				our daughter and family decided to move to a state with a lower cost of
				living, we realized it was time for us to simplify our life. We had
				friends in Arizona and enjoyed visiting here in the past. This has been
				a great relocation adventure.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am so glad I became a real estate agent here and am ready to help you
				in your real estate transaction.
