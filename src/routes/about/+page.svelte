				I am a mom of three and grandma of four. My husband and I recently relocated to the Tucson
				area to escape the wet climate of the Pacific Northwest. Before becoming a real estate
				agent, I spent my career life in aviation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I grew up, hanging out at the airport with my dad, who was a maintenance director for a
				corporate flight department. I always enjoyed helping my dad work on airplanes and I
				continued to help him even after I had children. While raising my three children was my
				focus, when my husband was laid off from his job after 9/11, I turned my hobby business of
				cleaning airplanes into a full-time business. I continued working in corporate and general
				aviation until we had the opportunity to move to Arizona.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being self-employed, I was easily able to work homeschooling our children around my work.
				Homeschooling gave us a great opportunity to enjoy our children to the fullest, even on the
				hard days. Homeschooling our kids is one of my best life accomplishments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time we have with our kids is so short and it wasn't long before they were all out of
				our home and established in their own homes. When our daughter and family decided to move to
				a state with a lower cost of living, we realized it was time for us to simplify our life. We
				had friends in Arizona and enjoyed visiting here in the past. This has been a great
				relocation adventure.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am so glad I became a real estate agent here and am ready to help you in your real estate
				transaction.
