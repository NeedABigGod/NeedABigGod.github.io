<p class="markdown">Do you feel frozen lately? Not because of the winter weather, but because you don’t know how to proceed with your business or financial decisions? This is the only way I can describe how I am responding to the current economy. On the one hand, I see the rising interest rates. On the other, I see the data from National Association of Realtors (NAR) that sales are up (<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-grew-for-third-straight-month-up-0-8-in-february" rel="nofollow">Pending Home Sales Grew for Third Straight Month, Up 0.8% in February</a><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>). On the one hand, I see increases in inventory. On the other, I see access to lending down.</p>
<p class="markdown"><img src="/img/blog/nar-housing-snapshot-feb23.png" alt="NAR housing snapshot"></p>
<p class="markdown">We can only make our financial decisions based on historical data and our own experiences. When my husband and I were starting our family in 1994, we bought our first home for $160,000. This was slightly above the median sales price for single family homes in the West I was not interested in historical data. I only knew we needed a house, and this was the best choice for us at the time. We knew our home would not lose value and, worst case scenario, we could always sell and hopefully make a profit.</p>

<p class="markdown">When I start to feel like everything is so expensive and the next generation can’t possibly manage the current economy, I have to reflect on how we managed. My parents were utterly shocked to see us pay so much for such an average home. Admittedly, we were reaching a bit because we wanted to grow into the home. </p>
<p class="markdown">We also bought with zero money down and at a 9% interest rate. Buying with no money down has not been as common during the buying frenzy of the last few years. Buyers simply have not had the time to deal with the financing requirements because they have been competing with multiple offers.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> When <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/all-cash-home-purchases-2021/" rel="nofollow">Redfin researched data from county records, they found that 30% of buyers in 2021 bought with cash</a>.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> Whether these situations will change with the slowing real estate market remains to be seen as the access to money has been complicated by the recent banking scandals. Even the rise in new home sales could be thwarted by the recent bank failures because builders will find lending dry up.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="markdown">Still, we have some serious problems in our economy that cannot be glossed over by introspection. We are enduring some policies that are counterintuitive to responsible fiscal behaviors. While we can look back on data to help assure our next decision, we must also be prepared to navigate difficulties ahead. </p>

	<p class="markdown"><img src="/img/blog/entryway.jpg" alt="Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify. Simplify."></p>
<p class="markdown">No matter the market, we are always perplexed by the decision to buy or to not
buy real estate. If it’s the decision between renting and owning, we weigh the
costs of the purchase against the costs of maintenance. If it’s the decision to
invest, the balancing act of tax advantages against return on investment plagues
our thinking process. No matter our situation, we should be seeking advice from
our trusted advisors. Who do you trust to help you consider your options? Where
are you getting your information?</p>
<p class="markdown">I always start my decision making process by understanding my terms. By
acknowledging these fundamental steps in your decision making process, you can
avoid being swayed or distracted by erroneous data and information. You can make
valid analysis of your options. We can understand the basic differences between
renting and owning, but how is rental income taxed differently than owner
occupied real estate?</p>
<p class="markdown">How ownership is taken and how the property will be used must be considered
before any transaction decision can be made. Investment property does not meet
all loan qualifications. Rental properties are taxed differently. Married
couples may buy property to own separately yet state laws may negate the terms
of the contract if the right terms are not clearly defined. Some people will not
buy a house with a contract. This is an interesting situation that does come up
from time to time. I personally will never sell a home without a contract. This
protects the buyer and the seller in full disclosure of their obligation and it
helps define the terms. Who, or what, is your trusted advisor to help you in
your specific real estate decision?</p>
<p class="markdown">Find a resource, or several resources, you can rely on with the help of a real
estate agent. A real estate agent cannot, and should not, advise beyond their
expertise. They can, and should, be the source for your source. In considering
what real estate agent suits your needs, consider how they are advising you. An
indication of a good real estate agent is how they help you find the resources
you need to make your decisions.</p>
