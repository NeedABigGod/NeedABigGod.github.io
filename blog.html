<p class="markdown">No matter the market, we are always perplexed by the decision to buy or to not
buy real estate. If it’s the decision between renting and owning, we weigh the
costs of the purchase against the costs of maintenance. If it’s the decision to
invest, the balancing act of tax advantages against return on investment plagues
our thinking process. No matter our situation, we should be seeking advice from
our trusted advisors. Who do you trust to help you consider your options? Where
are you getting your information?</p>
<p class="markdown">I always start my decision making process by understanding my terms. By
acknowledging these fundamental steps in your decision making process, you can
avoid being swayed or distracted by erroneous data and information. You can make
valid analysis of your options. We can understand the basic differences between
renting and owning, but how is rental income taxed differently than owner
occupied real estate?</p>
<p class="markdown">How ownership is taken and how the property will be used must be considered
before any transaction decision can be made. Investment property does not meet
all loan qualifications. Rental properties are taxed differently. Married
couples may buy property to own separately yet state laws may negate the terms
of the contract if the right terms are not clearly defined. Some people will not
buy a house with a contract. This is an interesting situation that does come up
from time to time. I personally will never sell a home without a contract. This
protects the buyer and the seller in full disclosure of their obligation and it
helps define the terms. Who, or what, is your trusted advisor to help you in
your specific real estate decision?</p>
<p class="markdown">Find a resource, or several resources, you can rely on with the help of a real
estate agent. A real estate agent cannot, and should not, advise beyond their
expertise. They can, and should, be the source for your source. In considering
what real estate agent suits your needs, consider how they are advising you. An
indication of a good real estate agent is how they help you find the resources
you need to make your decisions.</p>

	<span class="svelte-2zm3f0">6/22/2022</span>
	<p class="markdown">For me, living in Tucson has been like being on a permanent vacation. We are
newer residents, after living in the Pacific Northwest for over thirty years. I
decided when we started looking for our home, I was going to get a view, either
of the mountains or the sunset. It seemed like every home here has a view. Well,
that is a bit of an exaggeration. There are definitely more opportunities to
have some kind of scenic view here than there was in the city I previously
resided.</p>
<p class="markdown">We first had to get beyond the home inventory issue. The available homes for
sale were naturally limited by the hot Summer season, when a lot of people head
for cooler climates. Any homes that were coming up for sale were selling very
quickly due to the high interest in living in Arizona. I get it. It’s a great
state.</p>
<p class="markdown">When we walked into a home our agent recommended, one we were not really
interested in, we did not expect to get that emotional rush that happens when
you find the home you are meant to have. It had neither a view of the mountains,
nor the sunset. It did, however, have a patio space that captivated me. The
fence lines the open preserve space and the desert wildlife are regular
visitors, including rabbits, quail, and javelinas. While I didn’t get one of
those breath-taking views I thought I wanted, I love the privacy of this
property.</p>
<p class="markdown">We had a decent patio space in our backyard in our former home, but it was cold
and wet a lot, so sitting outside was not that appealing. Especially while
sipping my morning coffee. This patio just invites you to hang out there all
day.</p>
<p class="markdown">I never would have seen this patio if I had not let my real estate agent guide
us in our home search. I can’t say enough about how much she listened to our
long list of requirements, but was then ready for the right alternatives. This
is exactly the kind of agent I hope I am for my clients. I never want them to
miss out on a home that doesn’t look great on paper but gives you that “ahhh,
I’m home,” feeling when you walk in the door.</p>
